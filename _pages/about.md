I am a first-year graduate student at [**Purdue University**](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/), deeply interested in the captivating world of computer systems, with experience in AI and Machine Learning. My research aims to achieve high-streaming analytics by partially offloading computation to programmable network switches.

<!-- , advised by [Prof. Saurabh Bagchi](https://bagchi.github.io/) and [Prof. Vishal Shrivastav](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~vshriva/) -->

Previously, I spent four wonderful years as an undergraduate at LUMS. Supervised by remarkable advisors [Prof. Zafar A. Qazi](https://web.lums.edu.pk/~zafar/), [Ihsan A. Qazi](https://www.ihsanqazi.com/), and [Prof. Agha A. Raza](https://aghaaliraza.com/), I worked to create a more inclusive and robust framework for federated learning. Our focus on device participation in developing countries provided valuable insights into system heterogeneity and its impact on federated learning.

During my final year, I also worked under my brilliant mentors [Prof. Tianyin Xu](https://tianyin.github.io/) and [Prof. Owolabi Legunsen](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~legunsen/) at [UIUC SysNet](https://cs.illinois.edu/research/areas/systems-and-networking) on automatic testing for cloud system reliability. This experience deepened my fascination with complex systems, exposing me to real-world failures in heterogeneous hardware and software configurations.
